Check out the api running live [here](https://tristan-game-api.herokuapp.com)

## Running the app locally

If you want to run the app locally on your machine then follow the instructions below

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

The first thing you will need is Python. You can follow these instructions to install the latest version [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

Now you need to install the project dependencies, but before you do it's recommended to use a virtual environment in order to separate dependencies of different projects. Take a look at Python's documentation for virual enviornment here [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

#### Project Dependencies

to install the project dependencies you can run the command

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

in the project's root directory. This will install all the required packages from `requirements.txt` file.

#### Running the server

Double click `app.py` file to start the server. Make sure it's working correctly by navigating to `http://localhost:5000`

## Authorization

Some of the endpoints in the api require you to have permissions in order to process your requests. The permissions needed for the api endpoints are:

| endpoint                           | permission            |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| GET '/games'                       | get:games             |
| GET '/games/<certain_game_id>'     | get:games             |
| POST '/games'                      | post:games            |
| PATCH '/games/<certain_game_id>'   | patch:games           |
| DELETE '/games/<certain_game_id>'  | delete:games          |

these permissions are provided as part of the JWT that you include in your request before sending it. To ensure that the JWT gets processed correctly, in your request's headers include this header `"Authorization": "Bearer JWT"`. Replace `JWT` with the JWT that contains the permissions and do not forget the space.

At the moment the api does not have a front end through which you can create a account and get permissions and JWTs. That's why in `access tokens.txt` you can find two JWTs that have the permissions needed to interact with the api. The first one is for a guest user and has only the permission to view games in the api. The second is for an admin user and has all permissions.

## Testing

If you are running the app locally and would like to run the unittest script that contains tests I wrote for the api endpoints to ensure that it's working correctly, then run the following

```bash
python test_app.py
```
